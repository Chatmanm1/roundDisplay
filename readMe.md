### Rounded Display


#### Scope
This is a basic project to learn/utilize a 1.28" GC9A01 round LCD Display with Arduino Nano. I've created a basic "desk housing" and intend on using the display to show basic computer notifications/information. I will nead to write a python application as well as interphase with the pro micro passing information.

The microcontroller is very limited with memory space so will need to communicate information to display over serial. 

Due the reflective nature of the cube the header and cpp files needed to be rewritten as the stock files for the display did not support reflecting over Y series.

##### Features
- Display relevant computer CPU/RAM/CPU Usage.
- Send reactions via bumps taps etc. 
- Be notification screen for email etc. 
- read battery status of wireless devices and display / blink
- have slight interaction with user via pots and motors.
