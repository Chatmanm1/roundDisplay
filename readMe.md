### Rounded Display


#### Scope
This is a basic project to learn/utilize a 1.28" GC9A01 round LCD Display with Arduino Nano. I've created a basic "desk housing" and intend on using the display to show basic computer notifications/information. I will nead to write a python application as well as interphase with the pro micro passing information.

The microcontroller is very limited with memory space so will need to communicate information to display over serial. 

##### Features
- Display relevant computer CPU/RAM/CPU Usage.
- Send reactions via bumps taps etc. 
- Be notification screen for email etc. 
- read battery status of wireless devices and display / blink
- have slight interaction with user via pots and motors.
